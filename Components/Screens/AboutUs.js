                In the pursuit of sustainable rural development, the rejuvenation and creation of Water Harvesting Structures (WHSs) stand as vital initiatives within the ambit of the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY). These endeavors not only serve as sources of protective irrigation in rainfed regions but also significantly contribute to enhancing soil moisture, elevating water tables, and fostering agricultural prosperity.

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                Beyond their fundamental role in agricultural advancement, WHSs have proven to be transformative in another dimension. They have become catalysts for diverse livelihood activities, including fisheries and aquatic vegetable cultivation, among others. These activities, intricately linked with WHS utilization, generate substantial incomes for families and communities involved, thereby bolstering local economies andÂ livelihoods.
